## NetSPA
A series tracking SPA built with .Net Core 6 and React.  All series information is collected from the TMDB API.  I initially wanted to use the IMDB API but my request was declined.  When asked, I was told that it is only available for commercial use and the license is a bit out of my budget.

This was built as a coding assessment.

## Why This Stack?
Part of the assessment was that it used .Net Core and entity framework which explains the back end usage.

For the front end any server side framework was allowed, having not used React before but I wanted to challenge myself further.

Unfortunately I did run out of time in the end and this is the final result I was able to produce.  I will fork this in the future in order to complete and further my learning.

## Notes on items I never got around to:

 - When adding an item to the watch list it currently alerts, I wanted this to rather change the button text and color.
 - When no results are returned from the TMDB API it should notify that no items were found.
 - The home screen where a user may manage their watch items, I wanted to implement a Netflix style Season / Episode picker to jump around where you may be.
 - Styling - Overall I'm not happy with the styling, I unfortunately just ran out of time and also was a bit hazy on how I was wanting things to look as a whole.
 - I wanted to move all the actual DB interaction items out into their own repository, overall I neglected the repositories quite a bit while I was figuring out React. Not Great.
